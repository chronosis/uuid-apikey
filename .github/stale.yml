  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
  recent activity. Because the Out Of Sync team treats their issues
  [as their backlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog), stale issues
  are closed. If you would like this issue to remain open:

   1. Verify that you can still reproduce the issue
   1. Comment that the issue is still reproducible and include:
      * What OS and version you reproduced the issue on
      * What steps you followed to reproduce the issue

  Issues that are labeled as triaged will not be automatically marked as stale.
